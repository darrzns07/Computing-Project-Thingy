Disturbing Story

I entered the house and stopped dead in my tracks. The walls. They were covered in blood. A chill ran down my spine and I whirled around to see the door slam shut behind me. I stifled a scream and ran to the door, trying to open it but it was jammed. I returned my gaze to the bloody walls and saw a message that definitely not there before. " The strong prey on the weak, and I am hungry." I backed away, fearfully looking at my surroundings to see if anything was coming for me. Then I noticed the light switch next to me on the wall and I flicked it on without a second thought. The lights came on. Wait, where was the blood? And the message?? It seemed like I was seeing things in the dark and I laughed with relief, before going into my room. The lights went out. And I was face to face with a dead body hanging from my ceiling fan, its mouth open in a scream and blood pouring from every visible surface. I screamed, but no sound came out. Rushing out of the room, I glanced back to see another message appear. " I see you" I ran for the front door, forgetting that it was not going to open and my next step went down on a floor that was now littered with bones. I felt a sudden, sharp pain in my hand and i glanced down at it. It was gone, leaving a bloody stump at the wrist, where blood was pouring out. I collapsed, pain coursing through my body and I felt the invisible presence laugh in my ear before slowly, almost deliberately making the pain last, tearing my flesh while I lay there on the floor, screaming in agony as I was torn, limb from limb, flesh from bone.
